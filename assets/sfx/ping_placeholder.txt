This is a placeholder for the ping sound effect used by the WinDisplay. Please replace with real audio files:
- assets/sfx/ping.mp3 (recommended: 48–96 kbps MP3)
- assets/sfx/ping.ogg (recommended for browser compatibility)

Use a short metallic/digital 'ping' ~120–200 ms. Prefer normalized -6 to -3 dB.
