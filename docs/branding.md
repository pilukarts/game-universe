# Universe X - Branding guide (brief)

This folder contains the transparent-background logo assets for Universe X. Use the files as provided or request alternative sizes/variants.

Files added:
- assets/logos/universex_lockup.svg — Full lockup with "UNIVERSE" wordmark above a large "X". Vector SVG with transparent background, gold gradient fill and purple outline.
- assets/icons/universex_x.svg — Icon containing only the large "X". Use for favicons, app icons, buttons and small UI placements.

Recommended additional exports (I can provide on request):
- PNG raster exports at sizes: 2048×1024 (lockup), 1024×512, 512×256, 256×128, 48×24.
- Square icons for app use: 2048×2048, 1024×1024, 512×512, 256×256, 48×48 (use the X icon centered).
- Mono/flat versions (white / black) for high-contrast printing or restricted-color usage.

Usage notes:
- The SVGs have a transparent background. When placing the lockup over artwork, ensure sufficient contrast between the background and the gold fill. Use the purple stroke as separation.
- For UI headers use the lockup; for buttons and favicons use the X-only icons.
- Maintain clear space equal to at least 10% of the height around the logo in layouts.

Brand colors (approximate):
- Gold gradient: #FFD23F → #F2A900
- Purple outline: #4B0F6A
- Dark background reference: #0E0630

If you want, I can also:
- Generate PNG/WebP exports at requested sizes and push them to `assets/logos/` and `assets/icons/`.
- Produce white/black flat variants and versions with/without the purple stroke.
